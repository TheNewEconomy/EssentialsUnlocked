# EssentialsUnlocked: Because Someone Had to Fix It  

### The Adapter That Finally Makes EssentialsX Work with VaultUnlocked  

You know how EssentialsX has been around forever, and yet somehow, **after all these years**, they still haven't managed to get economy support right? Yeah, we noticed too.  

**EssentialsUnlocked** is here to do what should have been done **ages ago**:  
✔️ **Proper economy support** for **VaultUnlocked**  
✔️ **No more random balance resets** because someone couldn't figure out persistence  
✔️ **Works out of the box**—because we actually care about compatibility  

## 🔥 Why Does This Even Exist?  

Because EssentialsX has been dropping the ball on economy support **for years**. Every attempt at integration with modern economy plugins has either been half-baked, **completely broken**, or resulted in yet another wave of server owners screaming about lost player balances.  

Instead of waiting another five years for them to *maybe* fix it, we did it ourselves. **You're welcome.**  

Oh, and fun fact: **This README was written by AI.** Why?  
Because that’s exactly the **same level of effort EssentialsX put into fixing the town balance resetting issue.**

- **Bridges EssentialsX Economy with VaultUnlocked** like it should have been from day one  
- **Prevents those ridiculous economy resets** caused by EssentialsX mishandling third-party plugins
